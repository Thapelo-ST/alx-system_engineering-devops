<h1>Networking basics 02</h1>
This project is a continuation of Networking basics 1 but in this project we cover more ground


In this project we focused more on the IP structure and how to modify them and what are they really.


The ip <i>0.0.0.0</i> is a special IP address that usually signifies a wild card or all_inclusive value. It usually mean "any" or "all" IP addresses.

<i>/etc/host</i> is a plain text file that is used to map hostname to IP addresses. It acts as a local DNS resolver, allowing you to define custom host-to-IP mappings.


to display active network interfaces you use:

linux:


-ifconfig


-ip addr


windows: 

-ip config
