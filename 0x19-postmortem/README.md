# Issue Summary:

- **Duration:** August 19, 19:50 (UTC) to October 21, 14:25 (UTC)

- **Impact:**
  - **Service:** OneCmd
  - **User Experience:** Users experienced a complete outage of the OneCmd service for the entire duration. Approximately 100% of users were affected.

- **Root Cause:** 
  - The printing function in OneCmd was inadvertently disrupted during an attempt to align console output with specific checker/task snippet requirements.

# Timeline:

- **Detection:**
  - Detected on August 19 through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden increase in error rates.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated OneCmd components related to the printing function.
  - Assumed initial root cause to be an issue in the console output logic.
  
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially explored potential server-side issues, leading to wasted time and resources.
  
- **Escalation:**
  - Escalated to the development team responsible for OneCmd as the issue seemed code-related.

- **Resolution:**
  - Identified and rectified the issue by isolating the problematic code in the printing function.
  - Implemented a fix to restore normal operation of OneCmd.

# Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause:**
  - The printing function code in OneCmd was modified incorrectly, causing it to deviate from the expected output format.

- **Resolution:**
  - Restored the original code logic in the printing function, ensuring compatibility with the prescribed output format.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Strengthen code review processes to catch unintended changes early.
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities for specific output formats in critical services.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Conduct a comprehensive code review of the OneCmd printing function.
  2. Implement stricter version control to track code changes accurately.
  3. Introduce additional automated tests to validate console output against predefined formats.
  4. Provide enhanced documentation for developers regarding the expected output formats in critical services.
  5. Schedule regular training sessions for the development team to reinforce best practices and prevent similar incidents.

*Postmortem:*

During the AirBnB_clone project, an issue arose in the OneCmd service, leading to a complete outage for users. The root cause was traced back to a misconfigured printing function, which deviated from the expected output format. The incident, spanning from August 19 to October 21, was detected through monitoring alerts. Initial investigations took a misleading turn toward server-side issues, delaying the resolution process.

The incident was escalated to the development team, and the root cause was identified as a code modification error in the printing function. The resolution involved reverting the code to its original state, restoring normal service operations. To prevent future occurrences, corrective measures were implemented, including enhanced code review processes, stricter version control, additional automated tests, and improved documentation and training for the development team. These measures aim to bolster the overall resilience of critical services and reduce the likelihood of similar incidents.
