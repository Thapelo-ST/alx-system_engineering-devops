<h1>Networking basics</h1>
<prep>
In this project we covered a lot of ground and in a very indepth way as well

These are some of the topics we covered

The OSI model - a blueprint that helps to understand how different networking technologies work together to make communication possible in 

<i>OSI has 7 levels</i>

1. Physical layer

2. Data link layer

3. Network layer

4. Transport layer

5. Session layer

6. Presentation Layer

7. Application layer


<b>note that this presentation is bottom up meaning number 1 in the list is number 7 in reality</b>

We also covered the 

- LAN (local area network) that is just a network of computers and decives that are connected within a reletively small geographical area, like home, office, school etc.


- WAN (wide area network) that is a network that covers a larger geographical area, often spannig across cities, countires and even continents.


- Internet is a global network of connected devices, computers and servers. It has IP(internet protocol) addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) with their various types


We also dove in the depths of TCP and UDP 


- TCP (transmissiton control protocol) that alwas ensures that data is recived before ending the connection or exchange, its verry slow since its focused of accuracy and precision.


- UDP (user diagram protocol) that is focused on speed and connectionless. Thus being fast but its not reliable since it can give a load of data and dont chech where packets were lost and which packets are lost.


Then we have ports, its a numbered gateway of which you can think of them as a vitual door that allows data to flow in an out of a divice.

Some of the ports are

- SSH (secure shell) : port 22


- HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) : port 80


- HTTPS (hypertext transfare protocol secure) : port 443


In conclusion, I can say that, the OSI model is like a team of specialists, each contributing their expectise to make sure your messages, videos, pictures can travel smoothly across the internet. TCP and UDP determines how data travels, ports guide data to its destination, and tools like ping help you to ensure devices are connected and responsive.
